# DTL
Decision Tree Learning (DTL) is a machine learning concept where the machine is presented different options and runs each option by a threshold. If the option looks "promising" it follows that path, in the new path there are new options and they're run by the same thresholds, it picks the best choice until it reached a dead end and presents the path it took to the "best option‚Äù.
